# askui Example Project

 This is an example project which shows the usage of the [askui lib](https://github.com/askui/askui). 
 We use the library to automate: Closing Duplicated Github Issues.

## Reproduce

You can reproduce this example in your own github repository.
You just need to change the url of the github repository in the test file (`close-issues.test.ts`)
and create a issue and some duplications.

## Usage

Install all necessary packages:

```shell
npm install
```

Execute the example project:

```shell
npm jest --config ./test/jest.config.ts
```
